# For Loop Digit Reverse Triangle

A simple console-based program that prints a reverse digit triangle using `for` loops. 
The triangle starts with a sequence of digits and decreases the length on each subsequent line.

## Purpose

- Practice nested `for` loops.
- Learn to generate patterns in the console.
- Improve problem-solving skills using loops and conditions.
- Reinforce basic user input and output techniques.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and reinforced the following programming concepts:

- Nested Loops:** Used multiple `for` loops to build structured patterns.
- Reverse Order Printing:** Gained experience in decrementing loop counters to create reversed number sequences.
- Java Syntax:** Improved comfort with Java syntax and structure including loop control and console output.
- Pattern Logic:** Enhanced algorithmic thinking to map a visual pattern into code logic.
