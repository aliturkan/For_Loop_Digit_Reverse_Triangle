# For Loop Digit Reverse Triangle

A simple console-based program that prints a reverse digit triangle using `for` loops. The triangle starts with a sequence of digits and decreases the length on each subsequent line.

This project is ideal for beginners learning loop structures and algorithmic thinking in programming.
